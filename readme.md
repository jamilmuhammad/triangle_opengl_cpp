    This Program CPP with OpenGL and GLFW, and the main part of the code is the loop that draws the triangles. 
    
    The  positions  and  colors  vectors store all the vertices and colors for all the triangles. 
    
    The number of triangles drawn is controlled by the  NUM_TRIANGLES  constant. 
    
    The  scale  variable is used to calculate the size of each triangle. The  intensity  variable is used to calculate the intensity of the color based on the layer. 

    The  layerColors  array stores the colors for each triangle. The colors are interpolated from red to green, green to blue, and blue to red.

    The geometry shader code for the layered triangle effect is as follows: 
    #version 410
    layout(triangles) in;
    layout(triangle_strip, max_vertices = 3) out;
    in vec4 color[];
    out vec4 color0;
    void main()
    {
        for(int i = 0; i < gl_in.length(); i++)
        {
            gl_Position = gl_in[i].gl_Position;
            color0 = color[i];
            EmitVertex();
        }
        EndPrimitive();
    }
 
    The geometry shader takes a single triangle as input and generates three triangles as output. It copies the input triangleâ€™s vertices and colors to the output triangles. 
    
    The  glDrawArrays(GL_LINES, 0, positions.size() / 2);  function draws all the triangles. The  GL_LINES  parameter tells OpenGL to draw the triangles as lines. 
    
    The  glLineWidth(2.0f);  function sets the line width to 2.0 pixels. 
    
    The  glEnable(GL_BLEND);  and  glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);  functions enable alpha blending. 
    
    The  glClearColor(0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 1.0);  function sets the clear color to a dark gray. 
    
    The  glfwWaitEvents();  function waits for events to occur. The  glfwSwapBuffers(window);  function swaps the buffers to display the drawing. 
    
    Compile and run the code: 
    g++ hello_triangle.cpp -o hello_triangle -lglfw -lGL -lGLEW
    ./hello_triangle
    
    The output should be a window with five layered triangles. Each triangle is smaller than the previous one, and the color intensity decreases from the outer triangles to the inner triangles. 
    
    Conclusion 
    In this tutorial, you learned how to create a simple OpenGL program to draw layered triangles using the modern OpenGL 4.1 API. You also learned how to set up a GLFW window and GLEW library to initialize the OpenGL context.
